OpenGL3DSolarSystem
===================

A cheesy OpenGL (FreeGlut) 3D solar system including three planets, a comet and an orbiting moon plus lighting effects (specular, emissive, ambient, quadratic attenuation, etc.), animation, a menu system, transformation (scale, rotation, translation), and 3D shapes (Sphere, Dodecahedron and Teapot)
